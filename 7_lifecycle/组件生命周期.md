# The Component Lifecycle
Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. You can use this lifecycle diagram as a cheat sheet. In the list below, commonly used lifecycle methods are marked as bold. The rest of them exist for relatively rare use cases.

##Mounting
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

`constructor()`

`static getDerivedStateFromProps()`

`render()`

`componentDidMount()`



##Updating

An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:

`static getDerivedStateFromProps()`

`shouldComponentUpdate()`

`render()`

`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`

`componentDidUpdate()`

##Unmounting
This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

`componentWillUnmount()`

##Error Handling
This method is called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

`componentDidCatch()`
##Other APIs
Each component also provides some other APIs:

`setState()`

`forceUpdate()`

##Class Properties

`defaultProps`

`displayName`


#Instance Properties
`props`
`state`
